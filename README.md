# Discord User API
This Library is designed to allow for easy interaction with discord</br>
As if you were a real user account, instead of a bot

This is acheived by replicating the methods used by a normal account</br>
For authentication and interaction

# WARNING
This Program Does Not Work In Its Current State.
If You are using a project that uses this library, it is broken!
You can attempt to use the code on the legacy branch. But it is likely that the legacy branch will also not work.
